            <h3>What is DashAll?</h3>
            <p>
                DashAll is an urban delivery logistics platform (a mouthful, we know) founded in St. John's, Newfoundland that connects delivery drivers to customers.

            <h3>Wait, what does that mean exactly?</h3>
            <p>
                Well, with DashAll you now have the option of getting anything delivered, from anywhere (within reason of course).<br />
                This allows anyone to place an order for delivery from any restaurant or business in St. John's.
            </p>

            <h3>Who created this thing?</h3>
            <p>
                It was founded by two Memorial University students who were afflicted by things: <br />
                1. Disappointment by the lack of variety for deliverable meals.<br />
                2. An itch to create something that bounded their passion for technology and logistics alike.
